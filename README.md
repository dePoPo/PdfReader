# PdfReader
There is a point where all the bloat and pushy 'services' are enough, and you simply want to view your PDF file. This little reader does just that, nothing more, nothing less. It is little more then a simple wrapper around a very capable PDF control and as such get's teh job done without any bels or whistles.
